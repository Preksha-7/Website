<h1>India win 4th successive series as Australia hold on for tame draw in Ahmedabad</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Australia played out a draw in the final Test in Ahmedabad but India took the series 2-1 and won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the fourth successive time. India have also qualified for the World Test Championship final where they will face Australia at The Oval.<br><br>

While Australia dropped anchor to play out a draw with India in Ahmedabad in the final Test of the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, New Zealand won a last-ball thriller against Sri Lanka in Christchurch. New Zealand's 2-wicket win helped India secure their second successive World Test Championship final and from thereon, you could sense two teams involved in high-octane cricket for the last one month, were just going through the motions in Ahmedabad.<br><br>

Over four weeks of intense Test cricket brought India and Australia to the series finale with hopes of a 3-1 finish for the hosts. But that did not happen thanks to the pitch which had little help for bowlers and the resolute spirits of the Australian batters. A 3-1 win for India in the 2023 BGT would have taken any other result elsewhere out of the equation and taken them to the WTC final; however, it was just as well for India that Kane Williamson played one of the finest Test innings in recent times to deny Sri Lanka a shot.</p>
