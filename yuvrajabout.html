Yuvraj Singh is an Indian international cricketer widely regarded as one of the finest all rounders of all times.Undoubtedly, he is right up there among the greatest match-winners in white-ball cricket. 
Over the next few years, Yuvraj along with the then raw MS Dhoni became vital cogs of the Indian middle order that relished chasing down scores in ODI cricket. The duo often made a mockery of the opposition's target and India at one point even held a record for the most successful run chases in a trot.
He has made 8901 ODI runs while picking 111 wickets.</p>
